*Schedule:* Wednesdays 9:30-10:30AM at Johnson Pavilion 209

*Format:*

* Function of the week (15 minutes)

  The goal of this segment is to share a useful function or library
  with the group and give a brief example on how to use it. Bonus
  points for running an example live!

* Code review (40 minutes)

  The goal of this segment is to review an ongoing, unfinished
  programming project and receive helpful feedback from the group.
  Ideally, the presenter will be able to utilize the group's advice to
  generate forward progress on the project.

  The code presented should be less than 100 lines long. Presenters
  are encouraged to show "problem spots," or unfinished areas of the
  program, where they could benefit from peer suggestions and
  guidance.

*Rules:* No slides allowed! Please do not waste time making a
 presentation. Instead, please show the code directly, either in an
 editor or on GitHub.

*For presenters:* Presenters are asked to email the code to the group
 on the Monday before the presentation.  Please link to the code in
 its repository (preferred), or attach to the email.  In the email,
 please describe the motivation for this segment of code, your goals
 for writing the software, and the expected input/output.

*For reviewers:* Please read the code before the review meeting. See
 checklist below for some things to consider.

*For everyone:* I will do my best to foster a positive and motivating
 environment where we work together to learn from each other and
 improve our craft. Please talk to me privately if you feel like this
 is ever not the case. You may also contact Rick Bushman if you are
 uncomfortable coming to me directly.

*Checklist for code review:*

* Tests: Does the code have any tests? If not, are examples of input/output provided?
* Functions: Are functions/methods taking the right type of arguments? Does the function return one type of result? Are functions and methods able to be easily tested?
* Null/empty values: Will the code work if Null values are passed? If functions can return Null, will this work with the rest of the code?
* Idioms: Is code idiomatic where possible?
* Safety: Are tasks completed in the safest way possible? Will some valid inputs cause errors?
* Comments: Are tricky spots commented? Do comments describe intent?
* Documentation: Is there any documentation of functions? Is a README file included? What level of documentation makes sense at the current stage of development?
* Version control: How can commit messages be improved?
* Design (SUPER IMPORTANT): Are functions, classes, and modules well organized? Are functions or methods able to be easily tested? Could we do more to decrease coupling between functions, or to increase separation of concerns? Are we taking advantage of polymorphism when using objects?
* Examples of good practice: Do you notice particularly good habits in the code, which might be useful on other projects?
